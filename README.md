# My_CV_Software

I built this software (GUI) using PyQt and Python to showcase my CV in a professional way.
I used the setHtml method to incorporate HTML elements for better formatting and presentation.

This project highlights my skills in Python, HTML/CSS, and UI design.
However, due to some limitations and constraints within Python and PyQt, I wasnâ€™t completely free in terms of design flexibility.

I can't able to upload the app to direct download but i added pdf of software and py files in app folder
